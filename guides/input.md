# Input #

In this guide we will explain different ways to read the user input

## Input Events on Scripts ##

The Event driven input is meant to capture events that happend when the user interacts with the application, like keys pressed, mouse movements, buttons being pressed, etc.

If you are using a Script component you can catch the events easily using the auto-binded callbacks like:

- ```onMouseDown```: when a mouse button is pressed
- ```onMouseUp```: when a mouse button is released
- ```onMouseMove```: when the mouse moves
- ```onMouseWheel```: when the mouse wheel rotates
- ```onKeyDown```: when a key is released
- ```onKeyUp```: when a key is pressed
- ```onGamepadConnected```: when a gamepad is connected
- ```onGamepadDisconnected```: when a gamepad is disconnected
- ```onButtonDown```: when a gamepad button is pressed
- ```onButtonUp```: when a gamepad button is released

All this functions receive the system event by parameter.

```javascript

this.onKeyDown = function(event)
{
	if(event.keyCode == 39)
		console.log("Right");
}

this.onMouseDown = function(event)
{
	if( event.which == GL.LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON )
		console.log("Left mouse button pressed!");
}
```

Sometimes we are coding our own component for the Components pool. In that case we have to bind the events manually:

```javascript

this.onAddedToScene = function(scene)
{
	LEvent.bind( scene, "mousedown", this.myMouseCallback, this );
}

this.onRemovedFromScene = function(scene)
{
	LEvent.unbind( scene, "mousedown", this.myMouseCallback, this );
}

this.myMouseCallback = function(type, event)
{
	console.log("mouse button clicked:", event.button );
}
```

### Mouse Event
Because most of the actions are performed using the mouse, the MouseEvent events are enhanced with some extra properties and methods:

- ```x``` and ```y```: mouse coordinates relative to the canvas element (top-left)
- ```dragging```: true if the user was dragging the mouse (one button clicked).
- ```canvasx``` and ```canvasy```: mouse position in webgl viewport coordinates (bottom-left).
- ```deltax``` and ```deltay```: amount dragged in both axis.
- ```leftButton```,```middleButton``` and ```rightButton```: if the button is pressed
- ```dragging```: true if any button is pressed.


## Reading the current Input state

Sometimes you want to read the user raw input like the mouse coordinates, if a keyboard key is pressed or the gamepad axis.

In these situations you can use the ```LS.Input``` class to see the input state of:
- ```LS.Input.Mouse``` to read the mouse state
- ```LS.Input.Keyboard```to read the keyboard state
- ```LS.Input.Gamepads``` to read the gamepads state

### Mouse Input

When reading the mouse input you can access the ```LS.Input.Mouse```.

To access the mouse coordinates there is several ways:
- ```x```: x coordinate in canvas coordinates
- ```y```: y coordinate in canvas coordinates (0 is the bottom canvas position)
- ```clientx```: x coordinate in client coordinates 
- ```clienty```: y coordinate in client coordinates (0 is the top canvas position)

To get the mouse buttons state you can read the ```LS.Input.Mouse.buttons``` and mask to read every button state:

```javascript
if( LS.Input.Mouse.buttons | GL.LEFT_MOUSE_BUTTON )
	//...
```

or use the ```left_button```,```middle_button``` and ```right_button``` flags to check the state.

```javascript
if( LS.Input.Mouse.left_button )
	//...
```

### Touch events 

By default LiteScene converts every touch event in a mouse event, this disables using multitouch gestures but we will work on this in the future.

### Keyboard 

To read the keyboard state you can use the ```LS.Input.Keyboard``` where you have all the keys state:

```LS.Input.Keyboard["UP"]``` will tell you if the cursor UP key is pressed.
```LS.Input.Keyboard["a"]``` will tell you if the character 'a' key is pressed.

or you can use the keycode:
```LS.Input.Keyboard[32]``` will tell you if the RETURN key is pressed.

### Gamepads 

To read the gamepads state you use a similar approach:

```javascript
var gamepad = LS.Input.Gamepads[0];
if(gamepad) //is gamepad connected
{
  var x = gamepad.axes[0]; //here axes must be referenced using a number
  if( gamepad.buttons[0].pressed )
  {...}
}
```

or to read the axes directly:
```javascript
var x_axis = LS.Input.getGamepadAxis(0,"LX"); //returns the LEFT AXIS value of the gamepad 0
```

or to read the buttons directly:
```javascript
if( LS.Input.isGamepadButtonPressed(0,"A") ) //returns if the "A" button of the gamepad 0 is pressed
  ...
```




## Example ##

This example moves the object using the gamepad or the keyboard cursors.

```javascript
//@unnamed
//defined: component, node, scene, globals

this.moving_speed = 100;
this.rotating_speed = 90;

this.onStart = function()
{
}

this.onUpdate = function(dt)
{
  var x_axis = 0;
  var y_axis = 0;
  
  var gamepad = LS.Input.getGamepad(0);
  if(gamepad)
  {
    x_axis = LS.Input.getGamepadAxis(0,"LX");
    y_axis = LS.Input.getGamepadAxis(0,"LY");
  }
  
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["UP"])
    y_axis -= 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["DOWN"])
    y_axis += 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["LEFT"])
    x_axis -= 1;
  if(LS.Input.Keyboard["RIGHT"])
    x_axis += 1;
  
  x_axis = Math.clamp(x_axis,-1,1);
  y_axis = Math.clamp(y_axis,-1,1);
  
  node.transform.translate(0,0,y_axis * dt * this.moving_speed);
  node.transform.rotateY(-x_axis * dt * this.rotating_speed);
  
	node.scene.refresh();
}

this.onGamepadConnected = function()
{
  console.log("Gamepad connected!");
}
```
